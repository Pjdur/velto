# Contributing to Velto

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Velto! This project is a minimal async web framework for Rust, built on top of [`async_tiny`](https://github.com/pjdur/async_tiny). Whether you're fixing bugs, improving documentation, or suggesting new features — you're welcome here.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Run `cargo check` and `cargo build` to verify everything works.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of what you changed and why.

## Documentation

If your change affects the public API or user-facing behavior, please update the relevant documentation. Clear examples and concise explanations are appreciated.

## Feature Requests

Velto is intentionally simple and minimal. If you have an idea for a new feature, open an issue first to discuss it. Features should be broadly useful and align with the framework’s goals.

## Code Style

- Use `rustfmt` to keep formatting consistent.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Avoid adding dependencies unless absolutely necessary.

## Security

If you discover a security issue (e.g. related to routing, path traversal, or request handling), please report it privately via GitHub DM or email before opening a public issue.

## Thanks

Your contributions make Velto better for everyone. Whether it's code, docs, or ideas — thank you!
